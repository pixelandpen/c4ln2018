## IPFS and dat - John Fink

- decentralized data sharing protocols
- inter-planetary file system (IPFS)
- IPFS - permanent, P2P, replacement for HTTP
- crypto hash for each file, automatically deduped, can be given custom names, has own network stack
- dat simliar to IPFS, but is versioned, but doesn't dedupe, and is network agnostic
- ipfs://<hash> will redirect to the web location
- IPFS also has UI for seeing peers, admin tools
- Firefox and Chrome have plugins for viewing ipfs:// 
- when files pushed to IPFS copy(s) also stored in IPFS network (peer)
  - if file not requested for long time, then may be removed and only the original/local copy retained
- ipfs.io
- datproject.org


## Cipher Suites in Nginx and HAProxy - Giles Orr

- Google is down-voting non-encrypted websites
- Let's Encrypt is free certificate authority - but certs only valid for 3 months at a time
  - only proves that you control the website/domain
  - certificate authority will actually prove the identity of the organization
- SSL broken - don't use it; use TLS 1.2, 1.1 and last resort 1.0
- TLS 1.3 technically available, but still practically infeasible
- cipher suites are volatile 
- Mozilla has an SSL config generator (use the intermediate--to support old browsers--or modern setting)
  - https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/
- test your site with Qualys (https://ssllabs.com/ssltest) regularly because cipher suites are broken all the time
- at end of cipher suite string is list of algorithms NOT to use (e.g. RC4, 3DES and DES)
  - OpenSSL supports these broken algorithms for backwards compatibility 
- see https://www.gilesorr.com/blog/ for slides
- Q and A:
  - automation of testing?
  - nginx vs apache
  - SEO - down-ranking based on security tests, or just whether secured or not?
  - central IT and Let's Encrypt - often IT wants a 'proper' signing authority


## Automatically updating holdings on vendor platforms - Clara Turp

- problem: GOBI holdings don't match the library's actual holdings
- GOBI uses ISBN, but not used in standard way for electronic resource
- subscriptions and perpetual titles also complicated 
- project has two phases:
  - original upload into GOBI
  - monthly uploads 
- Clara has a partially automated process (takes about 14 minutes) 
  - query collections via OCLC because can get entire MARC record and use filters
  - use MARCEdit to extract and clean up MARC records and export CSV (with OCN, ISBN and Title fields only)
    - keep only records with ISBN
  - custom Python scripts to clean ISBN and make selection using comments (020 $q)
    - remove ISBN unmatched by GOBI
    - keep ISBN only for ebook titles
    - catch all lost OCN (only errors)
    - do some matching on partial title; remove punctuation and certain stop words; compare results between original list and list from GOBI
    - use OCLC's query API

## Lightning Talks

### Alan Harnum

- <randomphrase>.inlibraries.com - random library conference generator
- libraryvoices.alanharnum.ca - reads TPL's data feed of recent searches


### Kate Deibel - Low-hanging fruit of web accessibility 

- try to use the site without a mouse 
  - same experience? can navigate to everything? know where you are? hidden elements you tab to? pattern of navigation smooth?
- people with physical impairments that impact fine and gross motor skills outnumber blind/low vision
- tech details
  - arrange HTML in desired reading order
  - use tabindex to control nav order
  - hidden element should appear when gain focus
  - etc. (see slides)
- pay attention to colours - contrast is important; and color-blind (e.g. don't use red/green for identifying)
- Kate is working on creating an accessibility group
- kndeibel@syr.edu


### Kim Pham - Code4Lib Map

- https://github.com/code4lib/code4lib-map
- fork the repo and then add yourself to the repo JSON file

## Explainable Artifical Intelligence (XAI) and LIS - Mike Ridley

- we have an obligation to use AI in our field
- but also obligation to challenge it to make it more effective
  - we have tradition of humanizing technology 
- LIS has been slow to engage with AI, when compared to other disciplines
- Chris Bourg - "we would be wise to start thinking now about machines and algorithms as a new kind of patron"
- Safiya Nobel - Algorithms of Oppression (2018) - "AI will become major human rights issues in 21st century"
- Cathy O'Neil - Weapons of Math Destruction - "need academic institute focused on algorithmic accountability"
- Geoffrey Hinton - "the more powerful deep learning system becomes, the more opaque it becomes"
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
  - has concept of "right to explanation" for systems that make decision about an EU citizen - except for items that are deemed intellectual property
  - "Brussels Effect" - EU citizen covered by regulation with any system they interact with
- AI = big data + enhanced computation + advanced algorithms
- types of XAI
  - Proofs - causality, logic
  - Validations - feature audit, approximations, justification, XAI by AI, replication
    - feature audit == remove a feature and see what the results are
  - Authorizations - transparency, expertise, codes and standards, legislation, due process, audit, regulation
- what is the role for LIS in XAI?
  - e.g. push libraries to adopt software that is not black box - i.e. Google algorithm plays with search terms but it's not exposed - similarly, our own discovery layers are often a black box
  - instruction about societal/ethical implications of AI, via workshops, etc.
  - libraries need to understand AI and be conversant about it
  - libraries have a lot of structured data that can be used for machine learning
- a lot of AI toolsets are open-source - e.g. DARPA-sponsored projects; TensorFlow
- examples of AI in libraries
  - University of Rhode Island - AI Lab for Libraries
  - MIT - Andromeda Yelton - machine learning and theses
  - Ryerson - early stage of project
  - University of Calgary - using Passage AI - chatbots - developing a knowledge base


## Hackfest

- Docker and DevOps and converting legacy systems
