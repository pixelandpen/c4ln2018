## Towards holistic technology for libraries (a talk inspired by Ursula Franklin) - Alan Harnum

- Ursula Franklin - "Real world of technology" - from 1989 Massy Lectures (available to stream on CBC)
- Ursula K. Le Guin - "resistance begins with art...the art of words"
- "technology is a system", "how things are done around here", "not the icing on the cake, but part of the cake itself"
- holistic technologies - associated with ideas of craft and individual work; product-oriented; person doing the work in control of major aspect of the work; e.g. potter with clay
- prescriptive technologies - associated with mass-scale production and control; process-oriented; break down work into discrete, repeatable steps; e.g. factory; present in ancient cultures; can be dehumanizing and alienating
- broad historical trends in tech adoption
  - invention
  - growth 
  - acceptance
  - standardization
  - stagnation - tech is so dominant, that alternatives are hard to envision
- "Franklin's earthworm theory of social change" - we are earthworms preparing soil from below; social change comes from seeds growing in well-prepared soil
- pressing for systemic changes requires understanding of impact on people, not just the economy
- when critiquing change, need to ask who will benefit from this?
- Franklin talks about reciprocity in systems - i.e. there is a give and take between users and the system
