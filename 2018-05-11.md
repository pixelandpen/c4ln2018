- AI in Libraries - created a list on https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/awesome_ai_for_libraries


## Towards holistic technology for libraries (a talk inspired by Ursula Franklin) - Alan Harnum

- Ursula Franklin - "Real world of technology" - from 1989 Massy Lectures (available to stream on CBC)
- Ursula K. Le Guin - "resistance begins with art...the art of words"
- "technology is a system", "how things are done around here", "not the icing on the cake, but part of the cake itself"
- holistic technologies - associated with ideas of craft and individual work; product-oriented; person doing the work in control of major aspect of the work; e.g. potter with clay
- prescriptive technologies - associated with mass-scale production and control; process-oriented; break down work into discrete, repeatable steps; e.g. factory; present in ancient cultures; can be dehumanizing and alienating
- broad historical trends in tech adoption
  - invention
  - growth 
  - acceptance
  - standardization
  - stagnation - tech is so dominant, that alternatives are hard to envision
- "Franklin's earthworm theory of social change" - we are earthworms preparing soil from below; social change comes from seeds growing in well-prepared soil
- pressing for systemic changes requires understanding of impact on people, not just the economy
- when critiquing change, need to ask who will benefit from this?
- Franklin talks about reciprocity in systems - i.e. there is a give and take between users and the system


## Public Computing Service Delivery Model: work in progress - Gillian Byrne

- TPL is intentional in services and collections, but hasn't been in regards to public computing
- TPL has 17.4 million visits per year over 100 branches
- public computing is most used service at TPL
- have 7 "computer experienes" (types) e.g. children, with filtered access; public with full Internet access
- TPL data hub (using PowerBI) will be launched soon 
- auditing the printing and multi-function devices proved to be difficult
  - looked at usage of printing and searched for outliers
- for computer allocation, looking at e.g. 
  - number of bookings vs active cardholders by branch
  - use of "extended time" by branch
  - measure of computer downtime overall - i.e. build in some redundancy to compensate
  - guest computer use by branch
- the big question: how does your organization decide what software/utilities to provide on its public computers?


## Driving towards conformance: A WCAG 2.0 (AA) road trip - Mark W., Mariana J., Aneta K.

- Part of CAPAL WCAG study group 
  - Study the docs and unpack the guidelines
  - Provide enrichment activities
- Public institutions in Ontario have requirement for WCAG AA by January 1, 2021
- Conformance requirements:
  - If focused on Interface - Parts 1-3, 5
  - If focused on compatibility with user's browsers and assistive technologies - Part 4
- Gregg Vanderheiden - co-editor of WCAG 2.0 - webinar on May 17
- This is a team-based effort 
- PDF techniques for WCAG 2.0 (there are 23 of them)
- Library context - services and communication
  - e.g. D.G. Ivey Library (UofT) - Online Course Reader Service - all scanned readings are WCAG compliant before being uploaded to the service
- https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/
- Possible approaches to instruction
  - group training
  - online modules
  - learning from documentation
  - 1:1 mentoring
- Considerations for Group Training - from D. Fink 
  - Intentionality - question-oriented design
  - Integration - concept development and flow; evaluation based on learning objectives, which informs learning activities
  - Interdependence - bring in variety of experts across libraries and campus
- Considerations for 1:1 Mentoring - from Lipton, Wellman and Humbard (2003)
  - Consulting - one-way delivery of information for most part
    - share WCAG docs; show a11y tools; introduce the how and why of WCAG
  - Collaborating - co-develop info, ideas, and approaches to problems
    - e.g. jointly assess library websites using a11y tools; co-create tip sheets or toolkits
  - Coaching - mentee becomes self-directed learner
    - discuss broader issues depending on mentee's personal interests; ask questions that require applying knowledge to new contexts
